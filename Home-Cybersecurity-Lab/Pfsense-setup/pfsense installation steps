# 🔐 pfSense Firewall Installation – Home Lab Project

This repository documents the step-by-step setup of **pfSense** as the firewall and router for my personal cybersecurity home lab. It is the foundational layer for simulating real-world security scenarios and network segmentation.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

To deploy a robust and secure virtual network environment using **pfSense** to control traffic, monitor threats, and simulate enterprise-level infrastructure for cybersecurity practice and research.

---

## 🖥️ Environment Setup

- **Host Machine:** Windows Laptop
- **Virtualization Software:** VMware Workstation Pro
- **Network Configuration:**
  - WAN: NAT (for internet access)
  - LAN: Custom VMnet (for lab machines)

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### 1. Download pfSense ISO
- Source: [https://www.pfsense.org/download/](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)

### 2. Create a New Virtual Machine in VMware
- OS Type: FreeBSD 64-bit
- Attach ISO image
- Assign 5 network adapters


### 3. Configure VM Network Adapters
- Open **VMware Virtual Network Editor**
- Create/enable **VMnet2** and set it to **Host-Only**
- Assign VM adapters and correspond them with a VMnet interface 

### 4. Install pfSense
- Follow guided installer
- Select keymap, disk layout, and install to target disk
- Reboot

## 🌐 Post-Installation Configuration

- Assign interfaces (WAN = em0, LAN = em1)
- Set LAN IP statically: `192.168.1.1/24`
- Enable web configurator access via `https://192.168.203.1`
- Configure DHCP
