# üß± Windows Server Domain Controller ‚Äì Home Lab Project

This section of the repository details how I installed and configured Windows Server 2019 as a **Domain Controller (DC)** for my cybersecurity home lab environment. The goal is to simulate an enterprise Active Directory (AD) setup with a Windows Server DC and two Windows 10 client machines for group policy, user management, and attacker/defender scenarios.

## üéØ Project Goal

To deploy a centralized identity and authentication system using Active Directory with Windows Server 2019 as the Domain Controller and integrate it with other machines in the lab for real-world simulation of enterprise environments.
